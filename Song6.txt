
Will you listen just as my form starts to fission?
Losing this war of attrition just as I drift away

Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?


With the shadows longer to me than a lightyear
Moving so slow, I could die here
Say you can hear me say


Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?


Now I know why I woke up here on the shoreline
Coughing up blood in the twilight
Everything looks thе same


Will you halt this eclipse in mе?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?


I've got eyelids heavy enough to break diamonds
You pray for sound and I pray for silence
Damn right, faithless, I can't deny
You'll find me with half a mind to get violent
Oh, it isn't over 'til I say it's over
No more little angel sitting on my shoulders
So give me the edge of a blade and a time and a place
And I'll leave them cold and pushing up boulders
Am I walking with gods or merely stumbling forth?
Until there's fire at the gates, until I fall to the floor
You know I live by the feather and die by the sword
And I will sunder the earth only to burn the reward
Even in this garden of gardens, I am the god of the gaps
I am the demon of Sodom, I am the blood of an angel
The fate of the fallen, nobody knows where I came from
Even I have forgotten
How can I already lose my way like this?
Drowning in burning bright abyss
Even at stratospheric depths
This vertigo of bliss
[Bridge]
Oh, and I
I used to know myself
Oh, and you
You used to know me well
Oh, and I
Wish that I could leave myself alone
Oh, and you
You wish that you could make me whole


Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?
Will you halt this eclipse in me?

In me
