    "### Dataset: Sleep Token Lyrics (2019–2025)\n",
    "\n",
    "This project uses a small corpus of lyrics from six Sleep Token songs. The first three tracks, Blood Sports, Sugar, and Dark Signs, come from the band’s debut-era releases in 2019, while the latter three, Ghestomane, Look at Windward, and Dangerous, are drawn from their most recent album released in 2025. All lyrics are in English and the goal of this dataset is to explore how Sleep Token’s lyrical style may have shifted over time, as well as to identify distinctive linguistic patterns across songs. The corpus of lyrics was taken from the website genius.com"

    "Based on the extracted linguistic data, we can observe several distinct patterns across the six Sleep Token tracks that reflect different stylistic approaches and thematic focuses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**“Ghestomane”** stands out as the most lexically dense and narratively heavy piece. Its exceptionally high pronoun count (134) suggests a strong focus on perspective, intimacy, and relational dynamics, common themes in Sleep Token’s writing. The high noun (78) and verb (93) frequencies reinforce the sense that *Ghestomane* is rich in concrete imagery and action, with complex clause structures that make the lyrics feel expansive and emotionally charged.\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, **“Dangerous”** features some of the leanest linguistic structures: very few adverbs (13), determiners (10), nouns (33), and verbs (41). This may reflect a more minimalistic, repetitive lyrical style. The relatively low POS counts indicate a track that uses fewer syntactic elements to convey its message, relying more on atmosphere and musical delivery than on dense verbal content.\n",
    "\n",
    "**“Dark Signs”** shows a very different pattern. High adjective use (42) and frequent coordinating conjunctions (40) point to highly descriptive passages and a tendency to string together ideas or emotional states. The elevated counts of auxiliaries (47) and adpositions (43) suggest more complex verbal constructions and more layered spatial or metaphorical relationships—fitting for a song that deals with nuanced emotional undercurrents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**“Look at Windward”** displays high determiner use (47), substantial pronoun presence (93), and solid noun counts (66). This combination often signals lyrics that are specific, referential, and narratively clear. The structural density of the text hints at a song with detailed imagery or a developed emotional narrative.\n",
    "\n",
    "**“Blood Sports”** is pretty moderate overall, though the relatively high verb count (76) paired with solid pronoun usage (79) suggests a strong emphasis on action and interpersonal themes. For example, the repeated construction \"I wanna\" followed by action verbs (\"roll,\" \"feel,\" \"be forgiven\") creates a pattern of desire and agency. This linguistic pattern fits with the song’s urgent, confessional tone.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, **“Sugar”** appears distinctive in its use of proper nouns (18), far more than any of the other tracks. This may indicate references to named entities, symbolic terms, or repeating motifs that function like proper names within the lyrical world. The track uses the title word \"Sugar\" as a repeated vocative, functioning almost like a proper noun throughout the composition.\n",
    "\n",
    "Across all songs, numbers (NUM) remain consistently low (1–4), indicating that Sleep Token lyrics rarely draw on quantitative or literal detail. Instead, the band’s writing leans heavily into emotional expression, metaphor, intimacy, and imagery, reflected in the high concentrations of pronouns, verbs, and descriptive structures in many of the tracks.\n"

    "### Conclusions\n",
    "When comparing the linguistic profiles of the 2019 tracks to those from 2025, a consistent trend emerges: Sleep Token’s lyrics have become increasingly dense, elaborate, and syntactically complex over time. The first-era songs generally show lower counts across many linguistic categories, fewer nouns, verbs, adjectives, and pronouns overall. This suggests a more minimalistic or streamlined writing style early in their career, with lyrics that rely more on emotional suggestion and atmosphere than on detailed verbal construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, the 2025 songs, especially Ghestomane and Look at Windward, exhibit dramatically higher frequencies in key parts of speech such as pronouns, verbs, determiners, and adjectives. This shift implies that the band’s newer lyrical approach is more narrative, more descriptive, and more introspective. The rise in pronoun usage, for instance, hints at a deeper focus on identity, relationships, and internal dialogue, while the expanded use of nouns and verbs points to richer imagery and more dynamic emotional storytelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "This analysis is based on a small sample of six songs. A larger corpus would be needed to confirm whether these patterns represent consistent evolutionary trends or song-specific variations. Additionally, POS frequencies alone don't capture all aspects of lyrical complexity, other factors like metaphor density, narrative structure, and thematic depth would require qualitative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall pattern\n",
    "The data suggests Sleep Token's lyrics may have evolved toward more detailed, pronoun-heavy, and descriptively rich writing, though the extent of this trend requires further investigation with additional material."
