[Verse 1]
I wish I could have known that
Look in your eyes would echo in mine and go back
Out of my mind, across the line
When was the last time I felt like this?
Dark desire and tainted bliss

[Chorus]
It's like you're dangerous to me
I notice every time we meet
I feel the ground beneath my feet giving way
You've got me talking in my sleep
As if you're conquering my dreams
You have awakened what's beneath again

[Verse 2]
Well, I thought I could resist you
But something in me just can't help but insist
To blur thе lines just one last time so
Whеn's the last time you tasted blood?
What would it take to stem the flood?
And I am caught in time
Like clockwork beneath the permafrost
I might lose my mind
Back to back with oblivion
And you might breathe that burning breeze through
Paradise for me

[Chorus]
It's like you're dangerous to me
I notice every time we meet
I feel the ground beneath my feet giving way
You've got me talking in my sleep
As if you're conquering my dreams
You have awakened what's beneath again

[Outro]
Won't you show me how to dance forever? (Forever)
Won't you show me how to dance forever?
Won't you show me how to dance forever?
