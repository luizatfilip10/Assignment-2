[Verse 1]
And you play a twisted little game
But I know in a way
You need to complicate
Believe that though we never eat
We still know how to feed
We still know how to bleed (Oh)

[Chorus]
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now

[Verse 2]
My arms keep you in the room
Barely let you move
Show me what you do (Oh)
Tonight, we're second-guessed again
Let me wrap the chains
Addicted to the pain

[Chorus]
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now

[Bridge]
Do you wanna see how far it goes?
Do you wanna test me now, my love?
You must be crazy if you think that I will give in so easily
Things we buried low
Comin' to the surface now, my love
You must be crazy if you think that I will give up the game

[Chorus]
(Oh, whoa)
Sugar, I've got a taste for you now
Sugar, I've got a taste for you now
Sugar, I've got a taste for you now
Sugar, I've got a taste for you now
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
(Do you wanna see how far it goes?)
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
(Do you wanna test me now, my love?)
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
(You must be crazy if you think that I will give in so easily)
Sugar, I've developed a taste for you now
(Things we buried low, comin' to the surface now, my love)
(You must be crazy if you think that I will give up the game)
