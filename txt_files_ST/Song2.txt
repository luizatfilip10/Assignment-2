[Verse 1]
Where I was raised, there was no streetlights
Just pitch black and passing headlights
And where we met‚ there must have been dark signs
Omens in your skies

[Pre-Chorus]
Most days‚ you reach for safety
Remain calm‚ forget that you know me
And when we met, I could see dark signs
Alarm bells in your eyes

[Chorus]
And I miss the man I was
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
The moment we left off
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
And I hate who I have become
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
Every time I wake up
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)

[Verse 2]
And if you saw the marks on my dashboard
The new scars that I didn't ask for
And would you call asking for answers?
Tear my arms off

[Pre-Chorus]
And most days, you reach for safety
Remain calm‚ forget that you know me (Oh-oh)
When we met, I could see dark signs
Alarm bells in your eyes

[Chorus]
And I miss the man I was
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
The moment we left off
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
And I hate who I have become
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
Every time I wake up
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
And I miss the man I was
The moment we left off
And I hate who I have become
Every time I wake up

[Outro]
I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody
When we met, I could see dark signs (Oh)
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
When we met‚ I could see dark signs (Oh)
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
When we met, I could see dark signs (Oh)
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
When we met, I could see dark signs (Oh, no)
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
When we met, I could see dark signs, no
(I won't break and bend to my basic need to be loved and close to somebody)
When we metF
