[Verse 1]
I wanna roll the numbers
I wanna feel my stars align again
Even if the earth breaks like burnt skin
And the heavens just won't open up for me
Would you invite me in again?
Won't you pay for your arrogance?
Won't you show me your weakness?

[Chorus]
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I can't win
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I can't win
So let's play

[Post-Chorus]
And somewhere
Somewhere the atoms stopped fusing
I'm still your favourite regret
You're still my weapon of choosing
And out there
Stuck in a quantum pattern
Tangled with what I never said
You say it doesn't matter

[Verse 2]
I wanna be forgiven
I wanna choke up chunks of my own sins
Even if the sky cracks in mourning
And the heavens just won't open up for me
Would you invite me in again?
Let me pay for my arrogance?
Won't you show me your weakness?

[Chorus]
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I can't win
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I made loving you a blood sport
I can't win

[Post-Chorus]
And somewhere
(I made loving you a blood sport)
Somewhere the atoms stopped fusing
(I made loving you a blood sport)
I'm still your favourite regret
(I made loving you a blood sport)
You're still my weapon of choosing
And out there
(I made loving you a blood sport)
Stuck in a quantum pattern
(I made loving you a blood sport)
Tangled with what I never said
(I made loving you a blood sport)
You say it doesn't matter
