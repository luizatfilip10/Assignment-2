
[Intro]
I wanted you to know, I've learned to live without it
And even though it's colder now, I no longer feel surrounded
And you never listened to me, and that's the thing I tell the others
You were my harlequin bride, I was your undercover lover, but no
You never saw me naked, you wouldn't even touch me
Except if you were wasted
But you were trying your best, and that's the thing I tell thе others
I was your robot companion, you were my favouritе colour, and, oh

[Verse]
I'm caught up on the person I tried to turn myself into for you
Someone who didn't mind the push-pull parlour games
Someone who wasn't always cryin' on the journey back
Someone who didn't feel the low blows either way
Thought I was waiting for you, when all along
It was you with the countdown kill switch
And it was me with the blindfold on

[Pre-Chorus]
And I was trying my best, and that's the thing I tell the mirror
I was in love with the thought that we were in love with each other

[Chorus]
What might be good for your heart
Might not be good for my head
And what was there at the start
Might not be there in the end

[Post-Chorus]
Do you wanna hurt me?
Do you wanna hurt me?
'Cause nobody hurts me better ('Cause nobody loves me better)
Do you wanna hurt me?
Do you wanna hurt me?
'Cause nobody hurts me better ('Cause nobody loves me better)

[Bridge]
Came in like a dream, put it down like a smoke
We used to be a team, now we let each other go, yeah
Your cigarette ash still clinging to my clothes
I don't wanna stick around, I just wanna let you know
Came in like a dream, put it down like a smoke
We used to be a team, now we let each other go, yeah
Your cigarette ash still clinging to my clothes
I don't wanna stick around, I just wanna let you know
Came in like a dream, put it down like a smoke
We used to be a team, now we let each other go, yeah
Your cigarette ash still clinging to my clothes
I don't wanna stick around, I just wanna let you know
Came in like a dream, put it down like a smoke
We used to be a team, now we let each other go, yeah
Your cigarette ash still clinging to my clothes
I don't wanna stick around, I—


[Outro]
No one's gonna save me from my memories
Nothing to lose, but I would've given anything
To get closer to you and all your enemies
I've got a few of my own
And this throne didn't come with a gun, so I've got a different energy
I still see you when the lights get low
I still hear you when I'm on my own
The parasites in the nightmares calling my name like, "Please just let me go"
This one's for you and your problems, your good day job
Your bad karma, what are you afraid of?
The same trauma, show me what you're made of
'Cause you talk about your constant pain like I ain't got none
And I've learned to live beside it
And even though it's over now I will always be reminded
